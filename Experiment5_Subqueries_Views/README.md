# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL query that retrieves the all the columns from the Table Grades, where the grade is equal to the minimum grade achieved in each subject.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM GRADES g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MIN(grade)
    FROM GRADES
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);

```

**Output:**

**Question 2**
---
Write a SQL query to List departments with names longer than the average length
Departments Table (attributes: department_id, department_name)


```sql
SELECT department_id, department_name
FROM Departments
WHERE LENGTH(department_name) > (
    SELECT AVG(LENGTH(department_name))
    FROM Departments
);

```

**Output:**

**Question 3**
---
From the following tables write a SQL query to find all orders generated by New York-based salespeople. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.



```sql
SELECT o.ord_no AS ord_no, o.purch_amt, o.ord_date AS ord_date, o.customer_id, o.salesman_id
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.city = 'New York';

```

**Output:**

```sql
SELECT o.ord_no, o.purch_amt, o.ord_date, o.customer_id, o.salesman_id
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.city = 'New York';

```

**Question 7**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.



```sql
SELECT student_name, grade
FROM GRADES g
WHERE grade = (
    SELECT MAX(grade)
    FROM GRADES
    WHERE subject = g.subject
);

```

WHERE age < (
    SELECT AVG(age)
    FROM Employee
    WHERE income > 1000000
);

```

GROUP BY s.salesman_id, s.name
HAVING COUNT(c.customer_id) > 1;

```
